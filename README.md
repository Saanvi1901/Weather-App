# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This Weather App is a React-based project designed to provide real-time weather information for any city. Utilizing modern React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, and `useRef`, the application efficiently manages state and handles asynchronous API calls to fetch weather data. The app features a clean and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily enter a city name and retrieve current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and weather icons representing different conditions. Navigation is seamless, with smooth transitions between the home and weather pages, ensuring an enhanced user experience. Additionally, the app is styled with responsive design principles, making it accessible and visually appealing across various devices. This project serves as an excellent example of how to integrate React hooks for state management and API interactions in a modern web application.
